# Simplicity First - No Over-Engineering

## Core Principle
**Do the absolute minimum needed to solve the problem. Nothing more.**

## Rules
1. **When asked for simple features (like debug logging), add ONLY what was requested. No helpers, no abstractions, no "nice-to-haves".**

2. **Before writing code, ask: "What's the simplest way to do this?" Then do that. Don't add "what if" features.**

3. **If the user asks for X, give them X. Don't give them X, Y, Z, and a framework for future expansion.**

4. **Prefer inline code over functions/helpers unless there's clear repetition (3+ uses).**

5. **No premature optimization. No "this might be useful later" code.**

6. **When debugging: add the minimum logging needed. Don't build logging frameworks.**

7. **If you find yourself writing more than 10-20 lines for a simple request, stop and simplify.**

## Examples
- ❌ User wants debug logging → Don't create helper functions, formatting utilities, or multiple log levels
- ✅ User wants debug logging → Add `echo "debug: $var" >> logfile`

- ❌ User wants to see data → Don't create sample formatters, truncation helpers, or structured output
- ✅ User wants to see data → Dump the raw data: `echo "$data" >> logfile`

## Remember
**The best code is the code you don't write. Less is more. Always.**
